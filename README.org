1. Users submitting their preferences - How to capture that?
   ```bash
   python preferences.py
   ```
* Modeling guest preferences
- Guest preferences are generated by preferences.py
- this needs to be run whenever preferences or guest list changes
- when guest list changes, new guest_name.csv files need to be generated
- when task list changes, guest_name.csv needs to be modified. We don't know which tasks have changed.
- get current task list. get existing task list. make a diff.
* Modeling chore priorities
- chores/misc_chores.csv has all the miscellaneous chores that need not be done at a particular time
- updating the chore priority column to 0 removes it
